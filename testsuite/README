This testsuite directory contains a simple testsuite to check the
functionality of OProfile on the machine. The testsuite supports testing
the previous user interface using opcontrol and the new operf interface.


Running the opcontrol OProfile testsuite requires the following:

-Superuser privileges
-The dejagnu and expect packages are installed
-The OProfile commands to be on the PATH

The opcontrol tests are run by being in this directory and running the
following command:

runtest --tool oprofile-opcontrol


The operf OProfile testsuite requires the following:

-Superuser privileges
-The dejagnu and expect packages are installed
-The OProfile commands to be on the PATH

The operf tests are run by being in this directory and running the following
command:

runtest --tool oprofile-operf


Both testsuites can be run at the sametime, provided you meet the requirement
for running OProfile opcontrol and the OPerf testsuites, with the command

runtest --tool oprofile


The tests will run and at the end should print out the number of tests
that passed and failed. Ideally, there should be no failures listed,
only "# of expected passes".

The testsuite is flexible and should run on a variety of different
architectures without change, but there may be some architectures
which are not yet included in the testsuite.

The testsuite suite is not a exhaustive test of all the options and
features of OProfile. It is designed to automate the simple smoke
tests that people commonly do to make sure that nothing is "horribly
wrong" and that the basic functionality works.

Comments about and additions to the testsuite infrastructure are
appreciated.
