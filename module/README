samples.dat : the dump of count/pid/eip as a struct op_sample. This samples
file is the result of profiling at CPU_CLK_UNHALTED at 300000 a kernel
compilation + some minor things in foreground (emacs etc.)

diff-produce-samples : a diff between the main line and the oprofile
version used to dump the samples to disk. Mainly as reference if you want
to produce your own samples data file.

later I'll add the test function by extracting them from oprofile.c
