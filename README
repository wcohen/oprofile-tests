This is currently just a placeholder. It will contain
some tests for the post-profiling code to check for regressions
and test to easier understand how work some part of the profiler

Ideas on how to set up the testing harness are welcome.

thanks

The directory understanding contains test not intended to be run
automatically but rather to provide an easier way to understand
some sub-part of the profiler.
